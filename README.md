# Snek-Game
Redone version of the classic Snake game


I plan to create a system through which the user will play a version of the classic video game
snake. In this game, the user controls a snake which navigates the screen, trying to eat apples and
avoid obstacles. The snake moves at a constant pace, and the user presses directional buttons to cause
it to turn in the direction given by the button. Turning in the direction opposite to the snake's current
direction does nothing. The snake begins at a certain length, and its length increases whenever it eats
an apple by running into it on screen. When the snake eats an apple, a new apple appears at a random
location a moment later.

I plan to start by creating a simplified version of the graphic system, where each tile is a solid
color. I will feed a fake game state into it for the sake of testing. Once that works, I will try to create a
moving game which does not care about collisions and has no apples. After that, I plan to add collision
detection and the ability to lose lives. Once all of that is working, I will try to implement the
randomizer, testing mostly using Modelsim, and then use it to create new apples along with having
apple collision detection.

What I have learned throughout the courses of Khan Academy is the ability to code in ways I could not before.
Learning HTML and CSS set me up for the ability of backgrounds and sites to make and use for when I need. 
JavaScript has set me up to make playable games and make codes for other things along the way. With learning JavaScript and HTML and CSS,
adding them all together has helped me be able to create new things and make them functal. 
Khan Academy has set me up to continue with the skills presented throughout the course.
